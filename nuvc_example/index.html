      <h2> Application Process </h2>
      <p>Teams interested in competing in NUVC will need to submit an executive summary outlining their startup proposal. Competitors will be judged in the preliminary round based on the quality of the business model, sustainability, market opportunities, and finances. Teams advancing to the semi-finals and finals round will need to prepare a five and seven minute presentation respectively. Each presentation will be followed by a five minute question &amp; answer period during which the judges may ask the teams specific questions regarding the startup plan.</p>

      <p>Applications will open in January 2015.</p>
